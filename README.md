# xrd_file_processing_panalytical
Pared down version of xrc_analysis and rsm_analysis which just creates new datafile that converts raw data to arcseconds and normalizes the intensity of the curve.

I plan updated this as needed to specifically deal with processing RSM datafiles, 2theta-omega scans, etc.
